# Research Agent Guide

This file is the operating guide for agents and teammates working in `Research/`.

## Repository Role

`Research/` holds research code, configs, experiment status, and
results for diffusion-model privacy auditing. Product UI is in
`Platform/`; job scheduling is in `Runtime-Server/`.

## Fresh-Session Intake

Read in this order:

1. `<DIFFAUDIT_ROOT>/ROADMAP.md`
2. `<DIFFAUDIT_ROOT>/Research/ROADMAP.md`
3. `<DIFFAUDIT_ROOT>/Research/README.md`
4. `<DIFFAUDIT_ROOT>/Research/docs/README.md`
5. `<DIFFAUDIT_ROOT>/Research/docs/start-here/getting-started.md`
6. `<DIFFAUDIT_ROOT>/Research/docs/evidence/reproduction-status.md`
7. `<DIFFAUDIT_ROOT>/Research/docs/product-bridge/README.md`
8. `<DIFFAUDIT_ROOT>/Research/docs/governance/research-governance.md`
9. `<DIFFAUDIT_ROOT>/Research/docs/rebuild/README.md`
10. `<DIFFAUDIT_ROOT>/Research/docs/evidence/workspace-evidence-index.md`
11. The relevant `workspaces/<direction>/README.md` and `plan.md`

Do not start from memory or old chat context. Re-anchor on repository files.

## Current Operating State

- Active work: `H2 response-strength post-validation synthesis`
- Next GPU task: `none selected`
- CPU work: `PR #44 evidence sync and next-lane selection`
- No GPU task should start from documentation or governance cleanup alone.
- No history rewrite or force-push without a separate approved audit.

## Research Rules

- Paper reproduction is a starting point, not the full project.
- Every experiment needs a hypothesis, data plan, expected result, and conclusion.
- Report `AUC`, `ASR`, `TPR@1%FPR`, and `TPR@0.1%FPR` for promoted attack or
  defense results when applicable.
- DDPM/CIFAR10 results cannot be generalized to conditional-diffusion or
  commercial models without separate evidence.

## Workspace Structure

Current research state lives in:

- `workspaces/black-box/`
- `workspaces/gray-box/`
- `workspaces/white-box/`
- `workspaces/implementation/`
- `workspaces/intake/`
- `workspaces/runtime/`

Historical notes are in `legacy/workspaces/`. Don't add new dated logs to the
active workspace directories unless they are current summaries.

Use descriptive names like `Cross-box experiment boundary hardening` in active
docs, not run IDs.

## Public Documentation Rules

Public docs are for new contributors and external reviewers. They must not
contain personal machine paths, private operator instructions, raw agent prompts,
deadline pressure, or unverified product claims.

Use:

- `<DIFFAUDIT_ROOT>`
- `<DOWNLOAD_ROOT>`
- environment variables
- repository-relative paths

Run before pushing documentation or governance changes:

```powershell
python -X utf8 scripts/check_public_surface.py
python -X utf8 scripts/check_markdown_links.py
```

## Subagent Policy

Subagents are optional. Use them for bounded side work such as paper scouting,
review, or implementation slices with explicit write scope. Read-only is the
default. The main agent owns roadmap truth and result promotion.
