# DiffAudit Research Download Master List

> Root download directory: `D:\Code\DiffAudit\Download`
> Principle: top-level only grouped by `black-box / gray-box / white-box / shared`
> GitHub repositories are intentionally excluded because the agent can fetch those itself.

## 6. Defense-Relevant Assets

There is no separate top-level `defense` folder by request. Defense assets should be staged under the box they most naturally belong to:

- black-box mitigation assets → `black-box\...`
- gray-box defense assets → `gray-box\...`
- white-box defended assets → `white-box\...`
- reusable base models / datasets → `shared\...`

Most defense directions currently rely more on code and training than on special non-GitHub downloads.

High-probability external needs:

- DPDM released checkpoints or defensive artifacts, if any become available
- defense paper supplements with exact protocol details
- any non-GitHub released defended checkpoints for diffusion models

Recommended landing spots:

- `D:\Code\DiffAudit\Download\gray-box\supplementary\defenses\`
- `D:\Code\DiffAudit\Download\white-box\supplementary\defenses\`

## 7. What You Probably Should Download First

If you want to front-load the highest-value assets before we reopen serious experiments, do these first:

1. `SH-DS-01` CIFAR-10
2. `SH-DS-02` / `SH-DS-03` CelebA
3. `SH-WT-01` Stable Diffusion v1.5
4. `SH-WT-02` CLIP ViT-L/14
5. `SH-WT-03` BLIP large
6. `GB-WT-01` SecMI official bundle
7. `WB-SUP-01` / `BB-SUP-02` if you can obtain real supplementary artifacts

---

## 8. Storage Reality Check

You said you currently have about `200 GB` free and around `10 MB/s` bandwidth.

That means:

- core shared assets are feasible;
- one or two huge optional datasets like `LSUN` should be treated as optional, not first-wave mandatory;
- gated Hugging Face model downloads should be staged deliberately, not all at once.

My practical recommendation:

- first wave: CIFAR-10, CelebA, SD1.5, CLIP, BLIP, SecMI bundle
- second wave: optional open-CLIP fallback and alternate checkpoint families
- third wave: very large datasets / author-supplied extras / rare supplements

---

## 9. Already In Repo

These do **not** need you to re-download right now:

- GitHub code repos under `external/`
- local frozen competition package under `workspaces/implementation/`
- local gray-box and white-box run artifacts already staged in `workspaces/`
- papers already archived in `references/materials/`

If a future task needs them refreshed from upstream, I can tell you precisely which one.
